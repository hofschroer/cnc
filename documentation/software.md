# Software

This page lists some open source software packages, that can be used for the CNC mill.


## Fritzing
Fritzing is an open source software, that is used for prototyping and simple PPCB layout. It is very nice for documenting electronic circuits, because it has three views on a circuit: 
1. The prototype view
2. The diagram
3. The layout

The Layouts can be exported as SVG or Gerber format, so you can use it for drilling the pcb or for further processing to get the G-Code for milling later

## UGC Universal GCode Controller
The Universal GCode Controller

## GRBL-Plotter

GRBL-Plotter is a software that can be used to control the CNC Mill or a Plotter. It supports DIY-Controllers for controlling the machine. The controller setup shown in the GitHub page is able to connect to GRBL-Plotter.
