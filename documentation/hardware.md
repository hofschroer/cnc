# Hardware

## The Machine
The machine is a Proxxon MF70 Mill that can be used to mill and drill wood, plastic and aluminium

It has a high precision, but only a small working area.


## The Stepper Controller
The Stepper Controller was bought with the Kit and is connected with a 25pin parallel port cable. It can be used with Personal Computers from MS-DOS or realtime Linux. 



## The GRBL Controller
The GRBL Controlle is an Arduino running a Firmware that is called GRBL. This is very common for Mils and Plotters and ther is many Open Source Software available, that can use this controller.

It provides a USB/Serial interface where GCode can be send via serial connection.


## The Pendant
The Pendant is a MPG2 industrial controller, that provides an Emergency Switch, a rotary encoder with 100 step resolution and two switches to set Axis (off,X,Y,Z,4) and speed (X1,X10,X100).


## The Pendant controller
The Pendant is a very simple remote control, that is connected via single cables for each switch. To connect this to a computer or a CNC controller, you will need another Arduino controller.
