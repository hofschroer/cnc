# Introduction

## CNC Mill
This page shows how to set up a CNC mill. The example setup is a Proxxon MF70 with a commercial self-building kit that connects to a 25pin parallel port on a standard PC.

## LinuxCNC
The CNC Controller can be used with a PC, for example with LinuxCNC. This setup is very complicated, you will need a PC with old hardware and a Realtime Linux Kernel. 

## Commercial Software
For MS-DOS there exists also commercial CNC software like Mach3, that can be used to contol the machine.

## Open Source solution with GRBL on Arduino
In combination with modern PCs an arduino Controller is suggested to control the machine. You can connect the PC with USB to the Arduino and many simple GCode commands can be interpreteted by the Controller. The Firmware for the Controller is called GRBL and is an Open Source Project.
